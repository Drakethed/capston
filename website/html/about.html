        <h3>A little history of myself.</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up I was always over weight. I could never keep<br />
          the weight off for long periods of time. It wasn't until I <br />
          joined the military that I understood what I was doing wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          The military taught me that not only did I Have to eat well,<br />
          I had to exercise to stay the way I wanted to be.<br />
          This may be hard to understand for someone that thinks exercise is
          the<br />
          endall when they want to be healthy.<br /><br />

        <p>
          On this website you will learn how to be healthy physically.<br />
          The other two parts of the triangle is something that cant not be
          <br />
          taught and thats something you will need to discover for yourself.<br />
          I have found that when you're happy with yourself, the others come
          <br />
          easier than you could think.<br />
