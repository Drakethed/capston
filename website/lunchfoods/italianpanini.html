      <p>
        8 slices whole-grain sourdough bread <br /><br />
        4 Tbsp homemade or prepared pesto <br /><br />
        4 oz fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (Fresh mozzarella is both tastier
        and lower in calories than regular mozz, <br />but it's also more
        expensive. Any shredded part-skim mozzarella will work as a solid
        substitution, but if you can, <br />support a local farmers market and
        pick up some fresh.) <br /><br />
        3⁄4 lb cooked chicken <br /><br />
        1⁄2 cup roasted red peppers Olive oil<br /><br />

        Heat a large cast-iron skillet or stovetop grill pan over medium heat.
        Spread 4 pieces of the bread with 1 <br />tablespoon of the pesto each.
        Layer each piece with equal amounts of the mozzarella slices, chicken,
        and red <br />peppers. Add a light film of olive oil to the pan; when
        hot, cook the sandwiches (2 at a time, if necessary) <br />until the
        bread is crispy and the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes each side. (For
        the best results, use a heavy pan to <br />weigh down the sandwiches.)
