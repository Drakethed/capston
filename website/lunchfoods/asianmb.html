    <p>
      1 lb ground chicken or pork <br />
      1 small red onion, minced <br />
      2 cloves garlic, minced <br />
      1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger <br />
      1 Tbsp minced lemongrass (optional) <br />
      1 jalapeño pepper, minced <br />
      2 tsp sugar <br />
      1 tsp salt <br />
      4–8 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes<br /><br />

      Boston lettuce, steamed rice, pickled cucumber salad, ginger <br />
      scallion sauce, and/or sriracha for serving<br /><br />

      Preheat a clean, lightly oiled grill or grill pan. In a large mixing bowl,
      combine the ground meat with the onion, garlic, ginger, lemongrass if
      desired, jalapeño, sugar, and salt, stirring gently to evenly distribute
      all the ingredients. Roll the mixture into golf ball–size orbs, then
      carefully thread 3 or 4 onto each skewer. When your grill is hot, add the
      meatball skewers and grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side, until a light char
      has developed on the outside and the meatballs are cooked through. When
      done, they should feel firm, but springy to the touch. Use the lettuce and
      rice to make little Asian-style wraps with the meatballs, topping with
      cucumbers and your choice of sauces.
