        Ingredients 2 pieces thick-cut brioche bread <br />
        3 tablespoons low-fat Greek yogurt (or fat level of choice)*
        <br />
        3 teaspoons brown sugar, plus more for garnishing
        <br />2 teaspoons lime juice <br />
        1 egg <br />
        1 tablespoon unsweetened coconut flakes <br />1/4 cup fresh mango,
        peeled and diced 1 teaspoon lime zest
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        *Are you lactose intolerant? Because Greek yogurt has less lactose than
        regular <br />
        yogurt, many lactose intolerance people can still enjoy this type of
        yogurt.
        <br />

        Instructions 1. Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 5
        minutes.**
        <br />

        2. Use the back of a spoon to gently flatten the center of each piece of
        bread to create a well for the custard. Set aside. <br />

        3. In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt, brown sugar, lime juice and
        egg and whisk until the mixture is smooth. <br />

        4. Carefully spoon the custard mixture into the well on each piece of
        bread. Top with coconut flakes. <br />

        5. Carefully transfer the bread slices to the basket of the air fryer,
        being careful not to spill the custard mixture. <br />

        6. Air fry the custard toasts for 8 minutes at 350 degrees or until the
        top of the custard is firm and golden brown. <br />

        7. Use a spatula to transfer the custard toasts to a cutting board.
        Allow the toast to rest for at least 5 minutes, which will help the
        custard to set before cutting. <br />

        8. Top each slice of custard toast with fresh diced mango, lime zest and
        an additional sprinkle of brown sugar, if desired. <br />
        Slice toasts in half diagonally and serve. <br />
        <br />
        Notes: **Alternately, bake in a preheated toaster oven at 400Â°F until
        the custard is set and the toast is crisp, about 10-12 minutes. <br />
