        100 calorie sandwich roll, deli thin flats, Martin potato rolls, etc<br /><br />
        1 tbsp chopped scallions<br /><br />
        1 large Hard Boiled Egg, sliced<br /><br />
        1 tbsp light mayonnaise<br /><br />
        1 thick slice ripe tomato<br /><br />
        salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste<br /><br />
        <br />

        Assemble the sandwich by placing the egg on the bread, then the tomato,
        then scallion. <br />
        <br />
        Top with salt and pepper and spread mayonnaise on the top of the
        bread.<br />
        <br />

        Keep hard boiled eggs in your refrigerator for a quick breakfast on the
        go, to add to sandwiches or even salads. <br />It only takes a few
        minutes to boil a few eggs, here is a foolproof way to make perfect hard
        boiled eggs every time.<br />
        If possible, boil older eggs first. Fresh eggs are harder to peel once
        hard boiled. If you have an Instant Pot, you can <br />
        make Perfect Instant Pot Hard Boiled Eggs that are also easy to peel.
        For the same number of smart points and 50 more <br />calories, sub my
        Easy Bagel Recipe (live link) in place of your roll. Swap the potato
        rolls for my easy homemade bagel recipe <br />
        for the same Smart Points. Serve it open-faced on a slice of sourdough
        bread! You can make the sandwiches the night before and <br />wrap them
        tight with plastic for quick and easy breakfast to go.
