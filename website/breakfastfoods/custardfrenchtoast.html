      <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
       2 pieces thick-cut brioche bread <br>
       3 tablespoons low-fat Greek
      yogurt (or fat level of choice)* <br>4 teaspoons brown sugar,<br> divided 1 egg <br>
      1 small banana, peeled and sliced <br>
      1 tablespoon unsweetened chopped pecans<br>
      1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>
      *Are you lactose intolerant? Because Greek
      yogurt has less lactose than regular yogurt, many lactose intolerance
      people can still enjoy this type of yogurt.<br />

      <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
       <br />
      1. Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes.** <br />
      2. Use the back of a spoon to gently flatten the center of each piece of
      bread to create a well for the custard. Set aside. <br />
      3. In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt, 2 teaspoons brown sugar and egg
      and whisk until the mixture is smooth. <br />
      4. Carefully spoon the custard mixture into the well on each piece of
      bread. Top with sliced bananas and pecans. <br />
      5. Combine remaining 2 teaspoons of brown sugar and cinnamon in a small
      bowl then sprinkle evenly over the top of each slice of bread. <br />
      6. Carefully transfer the bread slices to the basket of the air fryer,
      being careful not to spill the custard mixture. <br />
      7. Air fry the custard toasts for 8 minutes at 350 degrees F or until the
      top of the custard is firm and golden brown.<br />
      8. Use a spatula to transfer the custard toasts to a cutting board. Allow
      the toast to rest for at least 5 minutes, which will help the custard to
      set before cutting.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Slice toasts in half diagonally and serve. <br />

      Notes: **Alternately, bake in a preheated toaster oven at 400Â°F until the
      custard is set and the toast is crisp, about 10-12 minutes.
