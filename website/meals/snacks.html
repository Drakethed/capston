        <h3>Trail Mix</h3>
        <p>
          Trail mix is made with nuts, seeds, and dried fruit, so it's a snack
          the packs
          <br />a nutritional punch. Not only is it high in protein (hello,
          nuts) but it's <br />
          also heart-healthy and good at lowering your blood sugar (looking at
          you dried <br />
          fruit). Any seeds in your trail mix are also likely to be packed with
          tons of <br />
          minerals and vitamins, including magnesium, according to
          Healthline. So while your <br />
          trail mix is fueling you up during that afternoon slump, it's keeping
          your heart <br />
          healthy, too.<br />
          <br />

          One thing to keep in mind: not all trial mixes are alike. Some can be
          loaded <br />
          with sugar thanks to all the chocolates and candies added in. (Look,
          we love <br />
          M&M's as much as the next person, but they're probably best left out
          of your<br />
          trail mix.) If you're looking for something sweet, stick to trail mix
          with dark<br />
          chocolate. When adding ingredients or buying a trail mix that's
          already made, <br />
          be sure to look for ingredients that are raw and unsalted. This not
          only keeps the <br />
          sodium low, but it allows you to really taste the flavors of these
          delicious <br />
          ingredients.

        <h3>Greek Yogurt and Berries</h3>
        <p>
          We love Greek yogurt — not only is it thicker than regular yogurt,
          helping us feel <br />
          fuller longer, it tastes good, too. Add some fresh berries and you've
          got a sweet <br />
          treat that is good for you. Not only will Greek yogurt fill you up,
          but it also helps <br />
          boost your metabolism, shares Medical News Today. Berries, on the
          other hand, are great <br />
          to add into the mix not simply because they taste great, but because
          they are low in <br />
          calories and have huge health benefits, including helping with brain
          function <br />
          (due to being rich in anthocyanidins) while also helping fight off
          cancer.Still <br />
          not sold? Berries (especially blackberries) also have the power to
          help reduce <br />
          inflammation.<br /><br />

          Use plain Greek yogurt and mix in your favorite berries for a sweet
          treat to keep <br />
          you full and energized. While this is the perfect treat on its own,
          you can also <br />
          drizzle some honey over top for some more added sweetness or sprinkle
          in granola <br />when you're looking for a little extra crunch.

        <h3>Popcorn</h3>
        <p>
          Popcorn is a great snack, and you don't even have to be sitting in a
          movie <br />
          theater to enjoy it (actually, it's probably better if you don't, as a
          large <br />
          popcorn at your favorite theater can contain almost 1000 calories with
          more than <br />
          your daily dose of sodium). So while we might associate popcorn with a
          giant tub of <br />
          the buttery stuff, the popcorn you should really be snacking on is a
          healthier version <br />
          made in the comfort of your home.Air-pop it and go easy on the
          seasoning.<br />
          <br />

          Popcorn is high in fiber, explains the American Heart Association,
          which helps <br />
          make you feel full and may lower the risk of heart disease. And when
          you make <br />
          popcorn at home it can also below in calories, depending on how you
          choose to top<br />
          it, so you can enjoy eating this snack without having to worry about
          overdoing it. <br />
          Dress up your popcorn with a touch of sea salt, chili lime seasoning,
          or a little <br />
          cinnamon sugar to achieve the flavor you love.
