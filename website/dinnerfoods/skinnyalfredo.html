        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
      12 oz. whole-wheat linguine <br />
      1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil <br />
      3 cloves garlic, minced <br />
      2 tbsp. all-purpose flour <br />
      1 c. low-sodium chicken broth <br />
      3/4 c. 1% milk <br />
      1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan <br />
      2 tbsp. plain Greek yogurt (optional) <br />
      Freshly ground black pepper <br />
      Pinch crushed red pepper flakes <br />
      Freshly chopped parsley, for serving <br /> <br>


      <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>

      In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook linguine according to package directions <br>
      until al dente. Set aside Â½ cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and set aside. <br> <br>
      In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. <br>
      Sprinkle flour over evenly, then stir and cook until mixture is lightly golden. <br><br>
      Very gradually add broth in while whisking, 2 tablespoons at a time, waiting for mixture to <br>
      become completely smooth before adding more broth. Bring mixture to a boil, then gradually <br>
      stream in milk while whisking. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. <br><br>
      Remove from heat and add Parmesan and yogurt, if using. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. <br><br>
      Add pasta and a 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to sauce and toss to combine. If sauce is too thick add more pasta water, <br>
      a tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency. <br><br>
      Garnish with parsley before serving.<br><br>
