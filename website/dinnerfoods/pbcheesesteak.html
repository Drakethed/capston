        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        1  Tbsp canola or olive oil<br>
        2  large portobello mushrooms, stems and gills removed, sliced <br>
        1 medium yellow onion, sliced <br>
        1 red bell pepper, sliced<br>
        1 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce<br>
        1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br>
        Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
        4 slices provolone<br>
        4 soft whole-wheat hoagie rolls, split and toasted<br>


        <h1>DIRECTIONS</h1>
        Heat 1⁄2 tablespoon oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.<br>
        Add the portobello slices and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until nicely caramelized.<br>
        Transfer to a plate. Heat the remaining 1⁄2 tablespoon oil in the same pan.<br>
        Add the onion and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and beginning to brown. <br>
        Return the mushrooms to the pan and stir in the soy sauce and Worcestershire. <br>
        Cook for another 2 minutes, until the vegetables have absorbed most of the liquid.<br>
        Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.<br>
        Divide the vegetables into four piles in the pan and top each with a slice of cheese (the residual heat will help to melt it).<br>
        Once the cheese has begun to melt, tuck the vegetable piles into the rolls. <br>
